# About

This project is about the classic computer science Dining Philosophers Problem.

We are going to work with concurrent algorithm, threads, mutexes and data racing.

# Introduction
Threads and mutexes

# 1. The Dining philosophers problem


Dijkstra, Edsger (1971). Hierarchiacal Ordering of Sequentioal Processes. Acts Informatica I.


"The processing unit of a working computer performs in a short period of time a sequence of millions of instructions and as far as the processing unit is concerned this sequence is extremely monotonous:
it just performs instructions one after the other."

"In the very old days, machines were strictly sequential, they were controlled by what was called "a program" but could be called very adequately a "a sequential program" (...)
With the advent of higher electronic speeds the discrepancy in speed between the central processor on the one hand and the peripheral devices on the other became more pronouced.
As a result there came for instance a strong economic pressure to arrange matters in such a way that two or more peripherals could be running simultaneously"

Ramadhan, Z. & Siahaan, A. (2016). Dining Philosophers Theory and Concept in Operatin System Scheduling. 

The operating system is aprogram that links the user and the computer system. This operating system must be capable of controlling resource usage. In the process of desining the OS,
there is a common foundation called concurrency. Concurrent processes are when the processes work at the same time. This is called the multitasking operating system.
Processes require synchronization to interact properly. However, the concurrent process that interact, there are some problems to be solbes such as deadlock and synchronization.
One of the classic problems that can illustrate the problem is the Dining Philosophers Problem.
